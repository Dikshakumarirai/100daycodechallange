What is java Abstract class?
A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in Java.
It can have abstract and non-abstract methods (method with the body).

Before learning the Java abstract class, let's understand the abstraction in Java first.

Sample Input

A tale of two cities
Sample Output

The title is: A tale of two cities
import java.util.*;
abstract class Book{
	String title;
	abstract void setTitle(String s);
	String getTitle(){
		return title;
	}
}

//Write MyBook class her
abstract class Book1{
    String title;
    abstract void setTitle(String s);
    String getTitle(){
        return title;
    }
}

class MyBook extends Book {
    @Override
    void setTitle(String s) {
        title = s;
    }
}

public class Main{
	
	public static void main(String []args){
		//Book new_novel=new Book(); This line prHMain.java:25: error: Book is abstract; cannot be instantiated
		Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
		String title=sc.nextLine();
		MyBook new_novel=new MyBook();
		new_novel.setTitle(title);
		System.out.println("The title is: "+new_novel.getTitle());
      	sc.close();
		
	}
}
