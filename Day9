What is String?
A string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable.
 
Inilized and define keywords:-
using :-substring method and compareTomethod.

Sample Input 0

hello
java

Sample Output 0

9
No
Hello Java

Explanation 0

String A is "hello" and B is "java".

A has a length of 5 , and B has a length of 4 ; the sum of their lengths is 9 .
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore, A  is not greater than B and the answer is No.

When you capitalize the first letter of both A and B and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".

SOLUTION:-
mport java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        String A=sc.next();
        String B=sc.next();
        /* Enter your code here. Print output to STDOUT. */
       
       System.out.println(A.length()+ B.length());
       System.out. println(A.compareTo(B)>0?"Yess":"No");
       System.out.println(A.substring (0,1).toUpperCase()+ A.substring(1)+" "+B.substring (0,1).toUpperCase()+ B.substring(1)+" ");

    }
}
