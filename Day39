what is java Reflection Attributes?
Reflection gives us information about the class to which an object belongs and also the methods of that class that can be executed by using the object.
Through reflection, we can invoke methods at runtime irrespective of the access specifier used with them.

public class Solution {

        public static void main(String[] args){
            Class student = Student.class;
            Method[] methods =student.getDeclaredMethods(); 

            ArrayList<String> methodList = new ArrayList<>();
            for(Method method:methods){
                methodList.add(method.getName());
            }
            Collections.sort(methodList);
            for(String name: methodList){
                System.out.println(name);
            }
        }

    }
