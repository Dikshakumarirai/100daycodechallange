What is inheritance?
Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. 
It is an important part of OOPs (Object Oriented programming system).

The above code will print:

I am walking
I am flying
This means that a Bird object has all the properties that an Animal object has, as well as some additional unique properties.

The code above is provided for you in your editor. You must add a sing method to the Bird class, then modify the main method accordingly so that the code prints the following lines:

I am walking
I am flying
I am singing

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;
import java.text.*;
import java.math.*;
import java.util.regex.*;

class Animal{
	void walk(){
		System.out.println("I am walking");
	}
}

class Bird extends Animal implements asd{
    void fly(){
        System.out.println("I am flying");
    }
    public void sing() {
        System.out.println("I am singing");
    }
}
interface asd{
    void sing();
}


public class Solution{

   public static void main(String args[]){

	  Bird bird = new Bird();
	  bird.walk();
	  bird.fly();
      bird.sing();
	
   }
}
